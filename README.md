# Sales-Forecasting

Forecasting the sales for the next 24 months using forecasting models like ARIMA and SARIMAX along with EDA and other techniques like using acf and pacf plots, decomposition, resampling,  plot diagnostics and testing with the ADFuller Test. The problem is a Univariate Time Series problem where the Sales is taken as a dependent variable in a dataset with over 9,00,000 rows.
Sales forecasting is helpful in anticipating future income by foretelling how much of a product or service a sales unit will sell over the course of the following week, month, quarter, or year.
